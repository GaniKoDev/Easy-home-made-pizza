    <!-- descripton  why pizza start  -->
    <p>Personally, my best evenings with friends or family are usually around pizzas! I love making it, with the dough (sometimes thin and crispy, I also like the thicker “bread” style pizza dough). </p>
    <p> Here is my personal recipe (I know there are hundreds), and also my favorite garnish: tomato sauce with homemade herbs, </p>
    <p>mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, Italian raw ham and fresh arugula (basil would have been so hot) .</p>
    <p> <b>The dough is very quick to make </b> (especially if you use a bread machine or a food processor) and should rise for 1 hour. Everything else is child's play,</p>
    <p>the garnish, I make it with my guests who choose what they want (tomato base or fresh cream, chorizo, smoked turkey, Parma ham or anchovies and olives...the one my mother favorite ).</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, make a well with the flour, and put the salt on one side, the yeast on the other <br>  (make sure not to put the salt and the yeast in contact at the start)</li>
                    <li>Add the water in the center, mix to obtain a homogeneous dough, and knead for 10 minutes by  <br> hand on the work surface or using a bread machine or a robot with the dough hook</li>
                    <li>Add the olive oil and knead for another 5 minutes</li>
                    <li>Cover with cling film in contact with the dough, and let rise for 1 hour at room temperature, <br> the dough should double in volume</li>
                    <li>Remove the air from the dough, pressing it with your hand, then divide <br> the dough into 2 or 3 balls depending on the number of pizzas desired</li>
                    <li>Let the balls of dough rest for 30 minutes, covering them with cling film</li>
                    <li>Roll out each ball of dough on the work surface (if the dough shrinks, <br> avoid flouring your work surface, it will stick and spread more easily).</li>
                    <li>Arrange the circle of dough on a plate with a sheet of baking paper <br> and garnish it with the pizza sauce before baking</li>
                </ol>
