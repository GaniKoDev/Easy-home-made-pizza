    <p>Personally, my best evenings with friends or family are usually around pizzas! I love making it, with the dough (sometimes thin and crispy, I also like the thicker “bread” style pizza dough). </p>
    <p> Here is my personal recipe (I know there are hundreds), and also my favorite garnish: tomato sauce with homemade herbs, </p>
    <p>mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, Italian raw ham and fresh arugula (basil would have been so hot) .</p>
    <p> <b>The dough is very quick to make </b> (especially if you use a bread machine or a food processor) and should rise for 1 hour. Everything else is child's play,</p>
    <p>the garnish, I make it with my guests who choose what they want (tomato base or fresh cream, chorizo, smoked turkey, Parma ham or anchovies and olives...the one my mother favorite ).</p>
